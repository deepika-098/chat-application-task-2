*Description:Real-Time Chat Application Using Socket.IO
focused on building a real-time chat application that allows multiple users to communicate instantly. This was achieved using Socket.IO for handling WebSocket communication and Node.js for the backend. A minimal HTML/CSS frontend was created, and the entire application runs on localhost. The backend listens for socket connections, handles user messages, and broadcasts them to other connected users in real-time. This task demonstrated practical knowledge of event-driven architecture, server-client communication, and real-time data handling. It helped reinforce the fundamentals of Express, WebSockets, and live data updates in multi-user applications.
